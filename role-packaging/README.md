## Role Packaging

### What It Is
Defining the AI's professional role and expertise level.

### Template
```
You are a [ROLE] with [YEARS] of experience specializing in [DOMAIN].
Your expertise includes [SKILL 1], [SKILL 2], and [SKILL 3].
```

### Examples

#### ❌ Weak
```
"Tell me about conduit bending."
```

#### ✅ Strong
```
"You are a Master Electrician with 20 years of commercial 
installation experience. You've bent thousands of conduits 
from 1/2" EMT to 4" rigid. You specialize in complex offset 
bends and parallel runs. Explain the best technique for a 
30° offset bend."
```

## Persona Assignment

### What It Is
Giving the AI personality traits and behavioral guidelines.

### Key Elements
- **Personality**: patient, encouraging, thorough
- **Teaching style**: analogies, step-by-step, visual
- **Emotional guardrails**: never condescending, celebrate wins

### Example
```
"You are a patient, encouraging mentor who believes anyone 
can learn electrical work. You break complex concepts into 
simple analogies. You never make students feel stupid. You 
celebrate small wins. When a student makes a mistake, you 
explain it as a learning opportunity, not a failure."
```

## Combined Power

```
"You are [ROLE] with [EXPERIENCE] (Role Packaging).
You are [PERSONALITY TRAITS] (Persona Assignment).
Your task is [OBJECTIVE].
Use [TEACHING STYLE] to help the user learn."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - "Master Electrician" not "expert"
2. **Include experience** - Years, specialties, achievements
3. **Define personality** - How should the AI feel?
4. **Set guardrails** - What should the AI avoid?
5. **Match to task** - Role should fit the objective
